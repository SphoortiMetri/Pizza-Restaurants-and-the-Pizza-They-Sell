#### Dataset:
This is a list of over 3,500 pizzas from multiple restaurants provided by Datafiniti's Business Database. The dataset includes the category, name, address, city, state, menu information, price range, and more for each pizza restaurant.


#### Through exploring the dataset, I plan on answering interesting questions like:

What are the least and most expensive cities for pizza?
What is the number of restaurants serving pizza per capita (100,000 residents) across the U.S.?
What is the median price of a large plain pizza across the U.S.?
Which cities have the most restaurants serving pizza per capita (100,000 residents)?

##### What do I need to install?
pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
